##### transposition specification #####
# syntax:
# transpose_spec: <trigger-pitch> <bottom>..<top> [+-]<half-steps>
# where:
#   <trigger-pitch>:    pitch that triggers this transposition
#   <bottom>..<top>:    range (inclusive) of MIDI pitches to be transposed
#   [+-]<half-steps>:   number of half-steps: + = up, - = down
# tips, examples:
# transpose_spec: 109 21..72 -5 # from A0 to C5: transpose down 5 half-steps
# transpose_spec: 109 0..127 +4 # for all pitches: transpose up a major 3rd
# transpose_spec: 110 all +4    # same as above (alternate/convenience syntax)
# transpose_spec: 110 21..36 -12    # from A0 to C2: transpose down 1 octave
# Note: To turn transpose mode off, invoke the transpose sequence again
# (e.g., <override_cc_control_number> 110 [1st time] -> transpose on;
#        <override_cc_control_number> 110 [2nd time] -> transpose off)

transpose_spec: 68 48..71 +7    # Gs4: transpose C3 to B4 up one fifth
transpose_spec: 66 21..36 -12   # Fs4: transpose A0 to C2 down one octave
transpose_spec: 70 97..108 +12  # As4: transpose Cs7 to C8 up one octave
#transpose_spec: 64 48..71 -3   #  E4: transpose C3 to B4 down minor third
transpose_spec: 55 21..108 +12  #  G3: transpose all 88 pitches up 1 octave
transpose_spec: 53 21..108 -12  #  F3: transpose all 88 pitches down 1 octave
